The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.

Novice owners, beware! Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. Alaskan Malamute are not well-suited to apartment life, and Alaskan Malamute are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep Malamute coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave a Malamute home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behaviour. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself. An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced owner, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate. However, if you can meet an Alaskan Malamute needs, you’ll have an intelligent, highly-trainable, loving companion for life.
