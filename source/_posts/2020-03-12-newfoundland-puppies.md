The Newfoundland is a large, strong dog breed from — wait for it — Newfoundland. Newfies was originally used as a working dog to pull nets for fishermen and haul wood from the forest. Newfies is a capable and hardworking dog, well suited to work on land or water. Newfies is a strong swimmer and equally strong “pack horse.” Sweet-natured and responsive, Newfoundland makes a wonderful family companion as well.

Originating in Newfoundland, Canada, located on the northeastern shore of that country, the Newfoundland, affectionately nicknamed "Newfie," shares a birthplace with the popular Labrador Retriever. The breeds are similar in character, sharing a desire to please, intelligence, a strong work ethic, friendliness, adaptability and versatility.

Surely you remember Nana, the fictional Newfoundland employed as a nanny by the Darling family in Peter Pan? Sweet-natured Nana was first introduced to the public by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie in his 1904 play, Peter Pan, which later became the well-loved kids' story we know today.

The Newfoundland really is a sweet dog who loves children. He's naturally gentle and friendly with them, as well as protective. Fans of this breed say the Newfoundland really is a natural-born babysitter.
