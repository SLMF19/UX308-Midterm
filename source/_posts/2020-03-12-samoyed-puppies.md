Samoyed originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night. The Samoyed is a working breed, the Samoyed can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs.

It's known as the "Sammy smile," the slight, but discernible, upturned corners of the Samoyed's mouth. The Samoyed is a happy, good-natured dog with a glass half-full attitude toward life and the people they lives with.

To this day, the Samoyed's reputation as an intelligent, dignified, family dog is well deserved. Samoyed are often chooses to dote on one special person in the household, but Samoyed's affectionate with everyone in the pack. Happiest when Samoyeds are a part of family life, this breed needs to be with people. In fact, leaving a Samoyed alone too much is the best way to make them miserable.
