Australian Shepherd despite their name, the Australian Shepherd originated in the western U.S., not Australia, around the time of the Gold Rush in the 1840s. Originally bred to herd livestock, Australian Shepherd remains a working dog breed at heart; the Australian Shepherd also known as Aussie, is happiest when they has a job to do. Australian Shepherd can be a wonderful family companion if Australian Shepherd intelligence and energy are channeled into dog sports or activities.

Australian Shepherd are intelligent, hard working, and versatile, the Aussie is a no-nonsense dog who thrives in a home where their brains and energy are put to good use. You don't have to keep a flock of sheep if you live with an Aussie — although it doesn't hurt — but you do have to keep Aussies busy. Australian Shepherd is a high-energy dog who doesn't know the meaning of couch potato and wouldn't approve of it if they did.
